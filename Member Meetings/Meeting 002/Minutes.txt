Darin White presented his "Brief History of KwartzLab" deck, and identified keys opportunities for growth:

  * more tools
  * more money (grants, fund-raising)
  * more events
  * more space
  
Eric Gerlach talked more specifically about opportunities for Space Expansion. No commitment has been made at this point; we are merely surveying possible options.

Alex Williams talked more specifically about tools which the lab would benefit from acquiring.

There was a detailed discussion among the membership regarding the sorts of larger projects they would like to pursue in the coming year, and ways to improve KwartzLab's outreach to the local community. Some needed infrastructure projects (storage, electrical, etc.) were also identified.

There was a brief discussion among the membership regarding inter-member communication, and how we can better keep all members in the loop of what's happening in the lab.
