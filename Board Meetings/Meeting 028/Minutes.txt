      locate the specifics for her.
      

   3. Space Expansion
   ------------------
   
   There was a detailed discussion regarding the feasibility of the 
   space expansion plan. In particular representative from the 
   membership asked why the Board was proceeding with the expansion 
   before we had the membership numbers to support it.

   The Board acknowledges that the situation is less than ideal, 
   however believes that KwartzLab membership numbers are stagnating 
   because of the limited resources currently available. It is the 
   Board's belief that by expanding space, and thus being able to 
   bring in more tools, KwartzLab will be able to increase its 
   membership numbers.

   The Treasurer confirmed that we currently have enough surplus to 
   cover a couple months went on the new unit. Additionally, if we 
   cut all discretionary spending, we'll be able to finance the room. 
   The board agreed that the current emergency fund could not be 
   touched for this purpose, and that we need to be able to continue 
   making contributions to the emergency fund.

   There are additional concerns that if we make initial investment 
   in the space, but did not achieve the expected membership 
   increase, and have to let go of the new space, it will negatively 
   impact our negotiating position should we want to expand again in 
   the future. For this to work, the expansion needs to co-incide 
   with an effective membership-drive campaign.
   
   The board explored alternate ways of financing the expansion, 
   including taking on member guarantors for the budget, or premium 
   levels of membership which would be awarded dedicated space for 
   higher dues. Concerns were expressed regarding what sort of power 
   dynamic that might create.

   Alternatively, the board also discussed the possibility of raising 
   dues across the board. This suggestion was divisive, and doing so 
   would likely result in our losing some members we already have.

   MOTION: Be it resolved that the Board will immediately pursue the 
   space known as the "Hobo Room" for $450 or less, with the intent 
   of taking possession as soon as possible. 
   
    So moved by Robert Gissing.
    Seconded by Ben Brown.

    Discussion: The Board confirms that this motion does not 
    pre-approve the lease contract. The Board will still need to 
    convene to approve any contract before it can be signed.

      The Board agreed, by general consent, to discuss a project 
      proposal received by Bhuran, regarding a monitoring system for 
      the whole building.
      
      Bhuran has noticed the security camera which we have outside of 
      our unit, and is interested in installing similar cameras on 
      all of the public entrances, and throughout specific corridors 
      of the building. They have asked if we would be interested in 
      putting something together for them, and will pay parts and 
      labour.
      
      Cedric Puddy & Ben Brown will follow-up with them on this.

      art wall installation. The Board agreed, by general consent.
      
      Ed expressed concerns regarding how the current installation 
      had been facilitated, and asked for confirmation that it would 
      not be up indefinitely. Robert Gissing confirmed that the 
      current installation was scheduled for the remainder of the 
      month, and that a new artist had all ready been selected for 
      May.
