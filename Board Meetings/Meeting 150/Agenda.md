## Recurring Business

### Previous Meeting Action Items
* Cedric - contact Dirt & Snow for quotes (was: circulate snow clearing details before next meeting)
	* 148: Invoice has been received and paid, to be removed from future minutes.
	* 149: Reviewed status and emails to Trevor so far; am waiting for a reply confirming the expected window.
	* 150: 
* James - Laser Cutter repairs update
        * 143: ($400 USD approved, tube order, laser to be moved, power meter, current check)
        * 144: power meter has arrived, tube has not been ordered yet (some research is required), much measuring has been done
        * 145: laser runs fine at 80%, and no unreliability so long as not overdriven, therefore so not urgent, want to move laser first.  We can get a new tube in about a week, and we have the money reserved.
        * 146: James to finish his diagram and bill of materials so as to make a proper proposal.
        * 147: James is continuing to explore the laser system and looking at the best way to fix/upgrade.
	* 148: Is ongoing, parts are being ordered, parts are in transit, Davenports solution is holding the line for the moment.  Tube is fine, everything else has been other issues.
	* 149: James is on track for having work done by end of Feb.  Laser was offline because someone moved it, and ripped the air hose off; the Jaymis used it on Tuesday, there was air then.  James needs to check the lens, becuase it may have been used while the air was broken, and may therefore be fouled.  If the water had been disconnected, it would have alarmed and shut down.
