Proceedings:
==============

1. Call to Order
----------------

The President Eric Gerlach acted as Chair for the meeting, and called the meeting to order at 1948 EST. The Secretary, Stephanie Smith, recorded the minutes. A quorum of directors was present, and the meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business.

2. Approval of the Agenda
-------------------------

The agenda was presented by the President. As the topic of "Bylaws" appears under both Old and New Business, the Secretary proposed that the entire Bylaw discussion be held under Old Business. The agenda, with this amendment, was approved by the general consent of the Board.

3. Approval of Previous Minutes
-------------------------------

The Board unanimously approved the submitted meeting minutes for November 11, 2009, November 18, 2009, November 27, 2009, December 2, 2009, and December 17, 2009.

Robert Gissing requested that the remaining 16 meeting minutes, to be considered at the next Board Meeting, be approved via a drinking game.

4. Report from the Treasurer
----------------------------

The Treasurer submitted a financial report to the Board, for review. He also confirmed that the membership has been notified regarding HST-related dues increase. He has canceled all outstanding PayPal subscriptions.

There was further discussion regarding Milkman Dan & the Mailman. Although a favourite, the provided comic was not of that oeuvre.

5. Old Business
---------------

  5.1. Website and Mailing Lists
  ------------------------------
  
  Update for action 13.2 on Ben Brown: convert website design to drupal 
  template.
  
    No update.
    
  5.2. Health & Safety Committee
  ------------------------------
    
    5.2.1. Update for 29.2 on Everyone: bring in phone for H&S; 
    activate with Eric's SIM. 
    
      Katrina Somers has donated a Nokia smartphone to the Board; it 
      was accepted with thanks.
      
      As this phone is overkill for what we need in an emergency cell 
      phone, it was suggested that with Katrina's approval we might 
      sell the phone, and use the money to (1) purchase a cheaper 
      phone, and (2) purchase some additional shelving/storage solution 
      for the lab.
      
    5.2.2. Board Procedure and Committee Appointments 
    
      No update.
      
    5.2.3. Report from the Health & Safety Committee
    
      Jessica Clayman reported that the Health & Safety Committee will 
      conduct a yearly inspection of the premises, timed around the 
      KwartzLab anniversary party (September/October). A check-list for 
      this inspection is still pending.
      
      There was a brief discussion regarding the usefulness of an 
      "Administracrap" calendar for all the things which need to be 
      done on a routine basis. Ideally, this calendar could send out 
      automated reminders to the appropriate parties.
      
      ACTION 36.1 on Stephanie Smith: implement administracrap calendar 
      module in drupal.

  --------------------
  
    5.3.1. Plan of Action for the Tool Room

    Alex Williams has begun working on an inventory of tools.

    No update
    
  5.5. Art Wall
  -------------
  
  Robert Gissing reported to the Board that he will be on CKWR Monday 
  evening at 1930 (Monday Night with the Arts), with Bernie, to talk 
  about Bernie's installation at the lab. He will also introduce 
  Jessica, as the new curator for the Art Wall project at KwartzLab.
  
  5.6. Bylaws and Elections
  -------------------------
  
    5.6.1. Update on action 35.2 on Ben Brown: Post poll to membership 
    regarding whether they would prefer to vote directly on offices, or 
    have the newly appointed board appoint offices.
    
      Done
      
  Eric Gerlach presented the Board with a draft of the Bylaws which 
  amalgamates the old Bylaws, and both his and Ben Brown's additions. 
  There was a detailed discussion, specifically regarding the new 
  clauses pertaining to nominations and elections.
  
  It was noted that these nomination procedures will not apply to the 
  coming election, and the election procedures will only apply if the 
  Bylaws are passed before the AGM.
  
  Topics of note:
  
    i) There was some disagreement regarding whether or not an election 
    should be called in the event of a vacancy on the board. 
    Alternatively, the Board could appoint an interim Director, or even 
    operate with a diminished Board, provided quorum was still met.
    
    ii) The question of whether to use a binary or ranged voting system 
    was very divisive. Is it better to allow for greater expressiveness 
    in voting, or to keep the system as simple as possible?
    
    iii) Should 24 hours necessarily be given for Board meetings, when 
    not all directors are present to consent? There have been instances 
    this past year where the Board has needed to call a meeting on 
    short notice, and not all Directors were able to be reached (i.e., 
    for the signing of the lease). This clause does help protect 
    individual directors from specific "shady" scenarios, but is 
    potentially more restrictive than we need to be.
    
    iv) The Bylaws should explicitly state that one director may hold 
    more than one office (i.e., the President may also be the Chair of 
    the Board.)
    
    v) An abandonment clause needs to be added which allows the Board 
    to terminated a member who stops paying dues but does not actively 
    withdraw.
    
  ACTION 36.2 on Eric Gerlach: revise the Bylaws Draft, and post to the 
  Members' list for feedback.
  
  ACTION 36.3 on Eric Gerlach: open nominations for Board Elections.
  
  5.7. Maker Faire Detroit
  ------------------------
  
  Ben Brown indicated that response to Maker Faire Detroit, both within 
  KwartzLab, and among the larger community, has been disappointing. 
  KwartzLab likely won't be organizing any sort of formal presence at 
  the Faire.
  
  5.8. Fire Inspection
  --------------------
  
    5.8.1. Update on action 35.3 on Ben Brown: ensure we have 3 good 
    fire extinguishers in our unit. 
    
      Done
      
6. New Business
