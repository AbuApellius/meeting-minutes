  A reimbursement cheque was not signed at the meeting, as a co-signer was

  6.2 Trillium Grants
  -------------------
  Robert Gissing presented an update to the Board regarding his inquiries 
  into Trillium grants. He would like to apply for the March grant cycle, 
  asking for $15000, which would go towards the purchase of a laser cutter. 
  Both Gordon Hatt (CAFKA) and Martin DeGroot (Waterloo Regional Arts 
  Council) have offered to review our Trillium grant proposal, and Martin 
  is also offering advise on how to proceed. Robert has also talked with 
  Mary Jo, from Trillium, who says that they will have time at the end of 
  January, if we want to come in and talk with them.

  Darin White presented to the Board regarding additional research he has 
  done on Trillium grants. In order to qualify for the grants, there are 
  various criteria we will need to meet. Specifically, there may be 
  concerns regarding the accessibility of some of our facilities (i.e., the 
  washroom). We may need to do some renovations.

  There was a brief discussion regarding renovations to make the washroom 
  wheelchair accessible.

  6.3 Wintereenmas Event
  ----------------------
  Jessica Claymen presented to the Board a summary of Wintereenmas as an  
  annual gamers festival, and her idea to hold a games day in the lab on 
  Saturday January 30 to celebrate it. From 7pm through 10pm, she would 
  like to open the event up to the general public.

  Motion: Be it resolved that the Board designates Saturday January 30, 
  2010, as Winteenmas Gaming Day, an event which will be open to the public 
  from 7pm through 10pm.
  	Motion Moved: Cedric Puddy
	  Motion Seconded: Ben Brown
	  In Favour: 5
	  Opposed: 0

  6.4 Membership Vetting Procedures
  ---------------------------------
  Ben Brown presented to the Board his concerns about the current 
  membership vetting process: currently, TON events are the only 
  opportunities which directors have to get to know new applicants. 
  However, a quorum of directors have not been making it to recent TON 
  events, potentially blocking new applicants from being accepted.

  There was a detailed discussion regarding possible solutions to this 
  problem:

  * there is a core group of members who regularly make it to TON events;   
  the Board could grant these specific individuals new member voting rights

  * the Board could appoint a membership committee which would vet new 
  applicants and then make recommendations to the Board (actually voting on 
  new members would still remain up to the Board)

  * new member voting could be opened up to the entire membership

  * when we know that a potential applicant is coming to a TON, an 
  announcement could be made to the Board, encouraging more Directors to 
  come out to the TON

  >> Action 12.2 on Robert Gissing: write a proposed motion for new member 
  approvals, and post to the BOD list for discussion.

  6.5 Outreach to Local Arts Community
  ------------------------------------
  Darin White presented to the Board a summary of recent outreach 
  endeavours towards CAFKA, Crime Lab, Jack Jackowetz. A more detailed 
  overview was posted to the mailing list.  

  There was a brief discussion regarding how KwartzLab bridges the gap 
  between art and technology, and the role we see for ourselves: 
  specifically, we're not trying to make hackers into artists, but we do 
  want to make technology more accessible to artists.

  The Board would like to thank Gus for his donation of resources and time
  in creating the frames for the public hanging of Jack Jackowetz's 
  artwork.

  6.6 New Equipment Acquisition
  -----------------------------

  6.6.1 LPKF Cabinet
  6.6.2 Radial Arm Saw
  6.6.3 Supply Closet

  Motion: Be it resolved that the Board empowers James Bastow to proceed 
  with obtaining the specified LPKF Cabinet, Darin White to proceed with 
  obtaining the specified Radial Arm Saw, and Cedric Puddy to proceed with 
  obtaining the specified Supply Closet, on the understanding that each of 
  these items are free-as-in-beer donations to KwartzLab. The Board accepts 
  all three donations.

	Motion Moved: Darin White
	Motion Seconded: Ben Brown
	In Favour: 5
	Opposed: 0 

  6.7 Space Expansion
  -------------------
  Darin White presented to the Board his ideas regarding the 800 sqft unit 
  off of the kitchen. Now that we are bringing in larger (noisy & messy) 
  equipment, a machine room is becoming a strong need. Adding this unit to 
  our existing space will be ideal, and in order to begin planning for it, 
  we should have an idea of what the rent will be. 

  >> Action 21.3 on Robert Gissing & Ben Brown: begin discussion with 
  Kaplay regarding that unit

  6.8 Site 3
  ----------
  Darin White presented to the Board that he, Ben, Gus, and Bevan will be 
  attending the inaugural Site 3 planning meeting in Toronto this Sunday. 
  Seth Harding has expressed a hope that KwartzLab will be able to provide 
  some input and guidance for this new venture. KwartzLab is excited about 
  this new venture, and we look forward to establishing a relationship with 
  Site 3.

7. Action Item Review
---------------------
  >> Action 21.1 on Ben will follow up on rent cheque, if it hasn't gone 
  through in a couple of days.

  >> Action 21.2 on Gus will wrote up a proposed motion for new member 
  approvals, and post to BOD for discussion

  >> Action 21.3 on Gus & Ben to start talking with Kaplay regarding that 
  unit.
