4. Boehmer Box Lease
-------------------------------

Eric Gerlach presented to the Board the results of a recent meeting
with Russ, the lawyer, regarding the Boehmer Box Lease. There are a
number of clauses which are of concern, and Russ has provided some
suggestions on addenda we should seek.

There was an in-depth DISCUSSION regarding which clauses give the
Board concern, and possible ways to address them. Any clause which
holds Directors personally liable are unacceptable. The wording on
other clauses (for instance: how the condition of the unit is
evaluated before and after we take possession;  under what conditions
taxes may increase; what constitutes a vacancy in the unit; bringing
in toxic substances) needs to be clarified, although these other
issues don't necessarily constitute deal breakers.

DECISIONS:

Motion Passed: Be it resolved that the Board will not approve any
lease which contains clauses that enable personal liability on the
part of Directors or other individuals in the corporation.
* Motion Moved by: Alexandra Dysinski
* Seconded by: Darin White
