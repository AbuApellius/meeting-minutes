4. Old Business
---------------

  4.1. Website
  ------------

    4.1.1. Update for action 13.2 on Ben Brown: convert website design to 
    drupal template 
    
    Outstanding.
    
    The Board agreed by general consensus that Ben could make any 
    necessary changes to the front page content without waiting on 
    input from Katrina Somers.

  4.2. Lease contract for borrowing member equipment
  --------------------------------------------------

    4.2.1. Update for action 17.1 on Eric Gerlach: Post draft of lease 
    agreement to members list asking for comment 
    
    Outstanding.
    
    The Board acknowledged that as lease arrangements will be approved on 
    a case-by-case basis, nothing needs to be formally approved as far as 
    the boiler plate document goes. However, we would still like the 
    membership to be aware of what the boiler plate document looks like. 
    To this end, although the we would like to have the draft posted to the 
    members' list, no business is currently being held up.

  4.3. Health & Safety Committee
  ------------------------------

    4.3.1. Update on action 22.1 on Stephanie Smith: post reminder Board & 
    Members to review draft Health & Safety policy

    Completed: Stephanie Smith reported to the Board that a last call to 
    review the Health & Safety draft policies was posted to the members' 
    list on February 5, 2010.

    4.3.2. Update on action 22.3 on Eric Gerlach: bring in his cell phone & 
    activate it. 
    
    Outstanding: Eric Gerlach reported to the Board that he has brought his 
    cell phone and its charger into the lab. The cell phone still needs to 
    be activated.

    4.3.3 Health & Safety Policy
    
    See attached Appendix B.
    
    Motion: Be it resolved that the Board accepts the Health & Safety 
    Policy, as drafted, allowing for edits which do not materially change 
    the policy.

      Motion Moved By: Eric Gerlach
      Motion Seconded By: Alexandra Dysinski

      Opposed: 0
      Abstained: 0
      
  4.4. Workroom Floor
  -------------------

    4.4.1. Update on action 24.1 on Robert Gissing: get second quote on 
    epoxy paint. 
    
    Completed: Robert Gissing presented the Board with an update regarding 
    workroom floor repair solutions. Epoxy paint cannot be applied to wood 
    floors. However, Home Hardware sells an acrylic floor paint, which will 
    probably meet our needs. The paint sells for $34/gallon/400sqf, and we 
    will probably need 4 gallons to cover the workroom floor.
    
    The Board continued discussing whether or not this was a space 
    improvement which needed to be done now, or if it could be postponed 
    until Fall 2010. There was question over whether this was primarily an 
    aesthetic issue, or if permanent damage is being done to the floor.

  4.5. Trillium Grants
  --------------------
  
  No update.

  4.6. Membership Vetting Procedures
  ----------------------------------

    4.6.1. Update for action 21.2 on Robert Gissing: write up a proposed 
    motion for new member approvals, and post to BOD for discussion 
    
    Outstanding: no update at this time.
    

  4.7. Space Expansion
  --------------------

    4.7.1. Update for action 21.3 on Robert Gissing & Ben Brown: start 
    talking with Kapley regarding that unit. 
    
    Outstanding: Ben Brown reported to the Board that he and Robert Gissing 
    will be meeting with Kapley in the following week.

  4.8. Signage
  ------------
  
  Ben Brown reported to the Board that he is obtaining quotes to have the 
  sign cut out of metal. He's looking at industrial grade, dark steel which 
  will need to be painted, and is hoping to be able to get it done for just 
  the cost of materials.

  4.9. Ubuntu Global Jam
  ----------------------
  No update.
  
  4.10. Member Meeting
  --------------------

  4.11. Update on action 24.2 on Eric Gerlach: post to members that we'll 
  be holding a members meeting on the 17. 

  Completed: Eric Gerlach reported to the Board that an announcement had 
  been posted to the members' list on February 4, 2010.
  
  The Board discussed feedback that's been provided regarding the meeting 
  agenda -- some members have indicated that they won't be coming, because 
  they are not interested in the procedural items. If motivation and 
  visioning is our main goal for the meeting, and we can't motivate we 
  members to come out to talk about them, then we've all ready failed. It 
  was proposed that the agenda be modified to focus on visioning, and make 
  the procedural items optional.

  Action 25.1 on Eric Gerlach:  post to list stating our intent to change 
  the agenda at the meeting -- move vision to the top, and only talk about 
  the rest if people are interested.

5. New Business
---------------

  5.1. New Equipment Acquisitions:
  --------------------------------
  
    5.1.1. The Knight Kiln
    
    Darin White presented the Board with Cathy Farwell's generous offer to 
    donate a Knight Kiln to KwartzLab Society Inc.
    
    The Board discussed the value that the kiln would bring to the lab 
    and our membership. This is a "red sticker" item, however, and training 
    will be required. We don't currently have anybody in-house who has 
    "expert knowledge" on using and maintaining a kiln, so we will need to 
    arrange outside training. 
    
    The Board further discussed space considerations for the kiln, and 
    whether or not the kitchen would be an appropriate location for it. 
    Cathy has said that we can postpone physically accepting it until our 
    space issues are resolved.
    
    Motion Moved: Be it resolved that the Board accept the donation of the 
    Knight Kiln, with a planned installation of June, 2010.
