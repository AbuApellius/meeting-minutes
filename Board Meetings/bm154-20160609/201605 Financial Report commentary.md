May 2016 Financials

Items of interest on our Statement of Financial Income & Expense:

   * $50 in public support is the money that Neil collected for the welding cart. This was deposited into the Phase 5 Heavy Lab Reorg account.
   * $3,076.98 in membership dues is 2 new member sign-ups, plus 58 invoiced members (plus 1 member who was invoiced in advance). We didn't lose anybody in May, so that's a growth of 2 members since April.
   * $11,306.29 in Maker Expo Spinoff is Maker Expo transferring their surplus from 2015 over to their own bank account. Going forward, I'll remove maker Expo-related accounts from reports, since there will be no more activity on them.
   * $39.97 in equiment maintenance are the V-belts that Bob picked up for the large drill press

The rest of our spending was normal operating budget items for the month (rent, hydro, etc.)

Our Net Income shows as a big whopping negative, because of the Maker Expo's 11K leaving out account. Our operational income for the month (ignoring the sale of the welding cart, and also the new member sign-up fees) was $2900. Our operational expenses for the month were $2136.76. That's an operational surplus of $763.24. Go, team!

Note that the operational expenses do equal cash out, however the membership dues do not necessarily equal cash in. The AR Aging report indicates how much of that $2900 we've actually received. (Hint: approximately 9 members still owe June dues.)

For those just joining us, any operational surplus which remains at the end of the year gets moved in to our discretionary fund next year. The discretionary fund is the money available for anything outside of our normal operational costs -- hosting special events, upgrades to our space, etc.

Moving on the Balance Sheet:

   * $100 still allocated for Bob's metal lathe budget
   * $47.40 has been added to our Discretionary Fund -- this is April's donations deposited into our chequing account
   * no changes to our Emergency Fund
   * the Operations Fund continues to float around in the low teens
   * $50 (from the sale of the welding cart) has been added to the Heavy Lab Reorg Phase 5 budget
   * SP Maker Expo has been emptied

And lastly, in the payment report at the very end, there is a cheque for an Air Liquid invoice that's dated 2015-12-08. This is a replacement for stale cheque #486 (originally issued in January). So the actual expense item doesn't appear in any of May's reports. Cheque #486 has been voided.
