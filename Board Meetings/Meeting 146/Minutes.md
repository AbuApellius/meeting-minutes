## Recurring Business

### Previous Meeting Action Items
* Cedric - contact Dirt & Snow for quotes (was: circulate snow clearing details before next meeting)
	* 144: we are waiting to hear from the city about the extent of our obligations
	* 145: appears to be moot, as there is no sidewalk to maintain, and it will likely continue as such.  Can we get quote for remaining bit of sidewalk, and option to have parking remain passable?
	* 146: Agreed that we will do the original quote, Cedric to contact D&S.
* Cedric - remove Erica Shelley from membership register
	* 146: Done; to be removed from future minutes.
* James - Laser Cutter repairs update 
	* 143: ($400 USD approved, tube order, laser to be moved, power meter, current check)
	* 144: power meter has arrived, tube has not been ordered yet (some research is required), much measuring has been done
	* 145: laser runs fine at 80%, and no unreliability so long as not overdriven, therefore so not urgent, want to move laser first.  We can get a new tube in about a week, and we have the money reserved.
	* 146: Laser appears to reliable at 80% (which generates correct current).  Power supply does not have pot for adjusting max current, so we still depend on user training for people to not exceed max power.  About $256 USD + shipping/duties for new 60W tube and Powersupply.  We could upgrade to 80W tube with new power supply for about about $60 USD more; has longer warranty (300 days instead of 180 days).  Current tube is 55mm dia, 80W tube is 80mm, might need to tweak cradles, which is doable.  Not in hurry, since entire power system has failed -- not all outlets come on when you turn on the switch.  Sick of fixing the things; would like to tear out *all* the HV power stuff, put in proper industrial controls.  Current relay is a open frame relay.  Would like to put in Start, Stop, and E.Stop button; Stop button should keep the vent and chiller running for 10 minutes -- folks will turn on the laser just to turn on the vent and such.  Thinking hardened industrial Ardunio, with flow meter for air and water (so you can have shutdown if they fail), hour meter on the laser, every output on independent relay, put in proper twist lock connectors.  James is going to finish his diagram and bill of materials so as to make it proper proposal.
* Steph: document best practices for treasurer & cash handling procedures for special events 
	* 143: Steph will draft a thing
	* 144: was not expected to be done today
	* 145: n/c
	* 146: not until christmas
* Ravi: talk to Ryan re: horizontal bandsaw repair
	* 145: status unknown; Chris not here.
	* 146: has not happened yet.  Leave it on.
