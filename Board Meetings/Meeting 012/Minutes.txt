 6.6 Lease contract for borrowing member equipment
 -------------------------------------------------

 >> Action on Eric Gerlach: Find out from our Insurance Broker what
 they need to constitute a legal interest in borrowed or leased
 equipment.

 We should generate similar paperwork for donated equipment as well.

 6.7. Policies & procedures for bringing in new equipment
 --------------------------------------------------------
 There was a lengthy discussion regarding whether or not new equipment
 acquisitions should be discussed with the membership before they are
 finalized. Doing so increases our transparency, and also helps
 encourage a sense of ownership among the membership. Where possible,
 we should try to use the following workflow for new acquisitions:

   1. Learn of an opportunity
   2. Inform members.
   3. Work deal out with source.
   4. Submit to Board for approval.

 There was further discussion regarding at what point we need to advice
 our insurance broker of new equipment acquisitions. We will need to
 develop an asset database.

 >> Action on Eric Gerlach: Find out from our Insurance Broker what
 sorts of equipment could change our premiums.

   In Favour: 6
   Opposed: 0
   Motion Passed.

 >> Action on Eric Gerlach: Draft a letter accepting the donation.
 >> Action on Robert Gissing: Draft an announcement of this donation
 for the list.

 When it comes, we should have a party to introduce the new equipment,
 and invite the guys from James' lab. We will also need to provide
 training.

 6.9 Drink Order
 ---------------
 Cedric Puddy presented an update to the board regarding the pending
 Coca-Cola drink order. Cedric will cover the upfront costs, and will
 try to get money from members to help cover the initial order: a $20
 donation gets you 20 free cans. It will be up to members to track this
 for themselves.

 6.10 Garbage
 ------------
 Robert Gissing presented to the board the need to organize regular
 clean-up duty for the membership. He suggested that we give the
 membership 2 weeks to indicate any scheduling preferences, and then
 create a weekly schedule, with 2 members sharing the duty every week.

 >> Action on Stephanie Smith: create a webpage to organize the
 schedule, and ask membership to indicate date preferences.

 >> Action on Robert Gissing: create a list of weekly clean-up tasks

 6.11 MAME Cabinet
 -----------------
 Michael Kowalski presented to the board that he has access to an
 arcade cabinet which he would like to bring in, and turn into a MAME
 cabinet for GPL'ed video games. He has the parts he needs to refurbish
 the cabinet.

 The board agreed by general consensus that he could bring the cabinet
 in to work on as a large project in the space. Once the project is
 finished, Michael is invited to offer it (on loan or as a donation) to
 the lab; at that time, the board will consider it following the
 standard new equipment acquisition procedure.

 6.12 Tuesday Open Nights
 ------------------------
 There was a general discussion regarding how the weekly TON events
 have been going. A successful TON event needs 2 members to host: 1 to
 man the door, and one to mingle and answer questions.

 Cross-posting TON announcements to the makekw.org mailing lists could
 improve our exposure.
