### Reimbursements & Purchase Approvals

#### Laser Cutter Repairs - needs discussion/approval
* amount: $400 USD - in discussion, James figures $700 CAD for both tube and power meter
* fund: Operations
* James believes it is the tube, not the relay
* James will move the laser to the wall where the exhaust fan is (which was the original plan); this is possible due to electronics benches moving
* James is looking for a deal on a laser power meter so that we can check tube performance over time; 
* There is a place in Montr√©al that we can get the tube from (same upstream vendor as G.Weike uses)
* James will install a panel mount USB port, and place a 4 port hub inside the unit; the auth key will move to the inside hub
* Manufacturer recommends < 22 mA operating current on the tube; James will calibrate power levels and see what current levels correlate with what power levels
* We are not going to buy laser glasses; would tempt fate.
