        --------------
        
        There was a brief discussion regarding what are the legal 
        requirements for processing voluntary membership withdrawals. The 
        KwartzLab Society Inc. bylaws currently do not specify any process 
        regarding voluntary withdrawals, so the Board just needs to 
        officially recognize & record the withdrawal.
        
        There was a brief discussion regarding the benefit in reviewing 
        membership withdrawals at general member meetings.

        		Abstained: 0

   6.3. Membership Hiatus
   ----------------------
   
   There was a detailed discussion amongst the Board regarding the intent 
   of membership hiatus, and what criteria should be used for approving 
   hiatus requests. The issue was agreed to be understood as "under which 
   circumstances we expect returning members to repay the $100 sign-up."
   
   The Board recognized the need to balance flexibility and a welcoming 
   atmosphere against a desire to make membership "sticky".  Not all 
   Directors were in agreement with how to do this. 
   
   The issue of hiatus first arose with the question of how to most fairly 
   accommodate co-op students, and some directors expressed the opinion 
   that it should be reserved only for such cases.
   
   A variety of concerns were expressed, including what would be 
   considered "fair" to active members, what exactly the $100 sign-up 
   fee is for, and how flexible any given policy should be. No consensus 
   was achieved on any of these points.
   
   This discussion was briefly interrupted by a recess, while the Board and 
   present members looked at available units in the building.
   
   Motion Passed: Be it resolved that the Board will recess at 2015EST 
   until we're done looking at the space.

 		  Motion Moved: Eric Gerlach
 		  Motion Second: Robert Gissing
 		  In Favour: 7
      Opposed: 0
      
 	  The Chair reconvened the meeting meeting at  2045EST.
 	  
 	  Motion Passed: Be it resolved that the following be adopted as a board 
 	  procedure

  		Hiatus
  		======

  		The Board shall not approve membership hiatus in cases other than 
  		co-op students for a co-op term, and shall not approve hiatus for 
  		durations other than four months.

  	      Motion Moved: Darin White
  	      Motion Seconded: Robert Gissing
  	      In favour: 4
  	      Opposed: 1
  	      Abstained: Cedric Puddy & Stephanie Smith
   
   Concerns were expressed that this motion explicitly restricts hiatus to 
   co-op students on co-op term.

   The Board also acknowledges that this policy does not explicitly address 
   the question of what sign-up fees should be paid by returning members, 
   and agrees by revisit the topic of sign-up fees for returning members at 
   a later date.
   
        6.3.1. David Hayes
        ------------------
        
        Action 23.1 on Stephanie Smith: notify David Hayes of the Board's 
        policy regarding membership hiatus.
        
   6.4 Ed Blanchard
   ----------------
   
   Member Ed Blanchard asked to address the Board regarding recent events 
   in the Lab. The Board agreed by general consensus to  let him speak.
  
   Ed stated that he greatly appreciates the work of Gus & Darin for the  
   5+5 event last night. However, he also has concerns that they are 
   carrying too much, and its not sustainable. He expressed the need to get 
   more involvement by the general membership.
   
   There was a general discussion by the Board and present members 
   regarding this point. We are a business, and we need to treat it like 
   so; as a business, we are all best served by having members who are 
   engaged and involved in the space. How can we foster this?  The lines of 
   communication with our membership aren't always good. We should hold a 
   members meeting to discuss our vision for the year.

   Motion Passed: Be it resolved that KwartzLab Society Inc. will hold a 
   members meeting in February, date and agenda to be determined.
   
 	    Motion Moved: Robert Gissing
 	    Motion Seconded: Darin White
 	    In favour: 7
 	    Opposed:  0
