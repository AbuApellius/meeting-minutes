* Action item: Create interim "members only" labels for the most fragile machines (Ravi)
    * Ravi has them in the bag.  They are not applied to anything yet.

### Membership Applications

#### Nelson Leung
* This has been approved on the mailing list, noting here for the minutes.  He has paid, and has received his key.  He seems nice, carbon based and bi-pedal.

* Amount: $13.99
* Steph says this has been done.

## New Business

### Snow Clearing
* Cedric to find out cost of the service at work.
* James to put a call out.
* Steph to try and track down the 50 Kent service.
* Our core need is to get the sidewalks done; driveway cut out and parking spots would be an optional extra.
* We recall that one service we explored in the past was $100/incident; nobody recalls if salt was included.  Ravi had been talking to a fellow who wanted $500/mo.  Research will be done.
* Nobody is to mention purchasing a snowblower.

### Membership Issues

#### Dirk Hiatus
* Dirk has asked that we extend his hiatus until March, for medical reasons.
    * motion to approve
        * by: Steph
        * seconded: Ravi
        * All in favour; motion passed.

### TWC Partnership
* Discussion of how important it is that the key tools work; it's clear that KwartzLab cannot offer service level guarantees on tool uptime.
* Ravi has committed to having the 3D Printers operational before 20-Mar.
* We have no reason to believe that the Laser will run into issues.
* There is no written contract as yet; they wanted an invoice for their accounting purposes.
* There is no insurance issue, as this is a sanctioned event that will have members present and participating.
* There is a PDF of the schedule which will need to be archived with the minutes.
* The dates are all set; Steph to add to the KwartzLab calendar.
    * motion to approve
        * by: Steph
        * second: James
        * All in favour; motion passed.

### Waterloo Region Mini Maker Faire (WRMMF)
* Ben has put info on the mailing list; looking at mid-September
* O'Reily event branding application is ready to go; we paid $500.  Our intention is to run a free event.  The intent is to have the lab pay the licensing fees.
* About 5-6 volunteers have been found as yet to work on the event.
* Proposal is to earmark $2500 for funding Waterloo Mini-Maker Faire; recognizing that the $1700 spent by Jaymis last time was recouped by sponsorship.
* In approving this, we are committing to KwartzLab being the official supporting organization for the event, which facilitates both licensing and insurance considerations.
    * motion to approve
        * by: James
        * second: Jaymis
        * All in favour; motion passed.

### UW Letter of Agreement
* The biggest question is how much it would cost to repair the printers.  The concern is that if we pick up the printers, are we going to potentially spend $1000 to get two printers that may or may not work, and may or may not be competitive.
* The prevous FDM printers generated great excitement when they arrived, and then did not result in actual work being done.
* The donation doesn't have any specific performance requirements, and nobody has as yet requested any money towards working on this.  We cannot commit money without a plan.  Our approach is that we are not going to block this; people can go get the printers, look at them, research possible fixes, and do a group buy to purchase any required parts -- the board does not believe we need another 3D printer, and as such is voting at this time to commit no funds.
    * motion to delegate Doug Moen to sign the letter of agreement on behalf of KwartzLab
        * by: James
        * second: Steph
        * All in favour; motion passed.

### Heavy Lab Reorganization

## Review of New Action Items from this Meeting

* James to get snowclearing quotes.

## Adjournment
* Motion to adjourn
