Hot things are hot; sharp things are sharp. Everything you do at
KwartzLab is at your own risk, so please use common sense.

Don't use equipment you don't know how to safely use. When in doubt,
find someone who can show you how to use it.

Don't use equipment, or the space, in inappropriate ways. Drinking and
power tools don't mix.

Report broken or damaged equipment to the Tool Committee or the Board of Directors.

If you're alone in the lab, no one can hear you scream. No one can help you, if you have an accident. Make sure you know where the emergency phone is, before you need it.
