4. A Toast
----------

President Robert Gissing addressed the membership, with a toast.

He shared a story about a job he completed down in Selma, Al. After a difficult week, he visited a local bar to unwind. The bartender told him that during the Civil War, Jesse James drank in that same bar. Gus asked what Mr. James drank. The answer -- Wild Turkey Bourbon. Since that day, Gus has made it a tradition to drink Wild Turkey, to celebrate a difficult job completed, or a significant milestone achieved. Today, he shares a glass of whiskey with all of KwartzLab.

"Its Gear Day! I get to do something that I've wanted to do all year -- be first among equals. This is really important to me, and I want to see it go. To all my friends -- we made this!"
