4. Report from the President
----------------------------

The President reported that he has invited several friends of the lab to the upcoming AGM, including other local hackerspaces and maker groups.

He also summarized a conversation held with several members on Tuesday, regarding the upcoming RIM Proud2Be donation. The consensus of the members he's spoken with is that we should put the money towards the purchase of a laser cutter. James Bastow recommends that KwartzLab purchase the same model that Site3 has purchased.

The President also addressed the need for greater transparency with regards to membership numbers and payment status.
