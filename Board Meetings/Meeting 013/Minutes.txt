The Treasurer provided a financial update to the Board -- all but 4 members have paid dues for the coming month.

There was a brief discussion reviewing Eric Gerlach's email of October 26, regarding the $400 initial insurance payment required by Erb & Erb. Our insurance payments are made 2 months in advance, so this initial payment covers our first three months, bringing us in line with that payment schedule.

6. Old Business

    template for review

    website template. It was well received, and the Board encouraged Ben to 
    proceed with turning it into a drupal template.

  -------------------------------------------------
  
    6.4.1. Update for Action 12.3 on Eric Gerlach: talk to our insurance 
    rep regarding what constitutes a legal interest for "leased" equipment 
    
    Cedric Puddy read for the Board Eric Gerlach's comments from his  
    2009-10-26 email regarding insurance and leases. Specifically, while we 
    don't need a lease agreement to cover equipment in our space, it is a 
    good idea to have one. It doesn't need to say anything specific, and no 
    money need be exchanged.
      
    >> ACTION 13.2 on Stephanie Smith: Compel Eric Gerlach to generate 
    appropriate verbiage for a lease contract.
    
  6.5. Policies & procedures for bringing in new equipment
  --------------------------------------------------------

    rep regarding what sorts of equipment will change our rates
    
     Cedric Puddy read for the Board Eric Gerlach's comments from his  
     2009-10-26 email regarding insurance and new equipment. Specifically, 
     we should alert Dave of "anything circular-saw risk or worse" coming 
     into the space. Because this venture is so different from things they 
     usually deal with, we should be proactive about keeping them in the 
     loop with regards to new equipment.
      
    There was a brief discussion on how to proceed. We will need a asset 
    list to drive this, which Health & Safety will ultimately be 
    responsible for, and which will be cross referenced with member 
    training.
    
    >> ACTION 13.3 on Stephanie Smith: create a google doc to track assets.

    There was a brief discussion regarding renting a truck with a lift gate 
    to transport the break.
      
    >> ACTION 13.4 on Robert Gissing: contact RIM facilities to see if they 
    can bring it to us.

      up, and about half of the membership has responded with their 
      schedule preferences.
      
    >> ACTION 13.6 on Stephanie Smith: Send out a a last orders call.

    6.8.2. Update for Action 12.10 on Robert Gissing: create a checklist of 
    cleaning tasks to be completed weekly

    Motion Moved: Robert Gissing
    Motion Seconded: Ben Brown

  7.5. Members contacting outside parties on behalf of the group
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  
  There was a detailed discussion regarding how KwartzLab interfaces with 
  outside groups. The primary concern is with the possibility of members 
  (unintentionally) misrepresenting KwartzLab, or making promises which 
  they are not in a position to honour. 
  
  As only the Board can enter into agreements of on behalf of KwartzLab, 
  the Board feels very strongly that only Board members should officially 
  represent KwartzLab to outside parties.
  
   >> Action 13.8 on Stephanie Smith: forward Mark's request to Gus, and 
   Gus will follow up with him.
   
  >> Action 13.9 on Eric Gerlach: work on wording for a notice to the 
  membership.
