## Recurring Business

## Old Business
* Christine - Volunteer Management
	* 149: During heavy lab discussion, questions about fresh ways to engage people in helping around the lab came up.  Plan was to talk further at meeting 150.
	* 150: Christine is now free of the TWC, and is now engaging on the volunteer
	* 151: An individual was approached to be a sort of safety equipment warden, and is interested given liability/indemnity -- the question is if we have someone periodically checking  the first aid kits, do they take on liability.  Nobody has indemnity, and DOLI does not provide coverage that the member is looking for, therefore liability/indemnity coverage is not possible.  Christine will be updating the wiki and approaching additional people before next meeting.
	* 152: Has been talking with Sean Stoughten; see above for details.
	* 153: 

* Front and Back Doors:
	* 147: Jaymis awaiting quote from G&A before taking further action. Ravi to enquire to see if we can get a second quote. Once quotes are received Jaymis will contact Christian to see about sharing costs. 
	* [...]
	* 152: Davenport's not here, man.
	* 153:
* Maker Expo 2016 firing up.
	* Per meeting 149, KwartzLab is the support org for MakerExpo, first meeting was to be 2016-01-21, event will be 2016-09-10
	* This entry for tracking status.
	* [...]
	* 152: Neil - moving right along; funding is promised but not yet received, trending towards $20k over last year.  Looking for signature events -- artists/etc that can make an immersive event/draw.  
	* 153:
* Heavy Lab update from Neil.
	* Per meeting 149, Neil is moving forward with phases 5 & 6, new welding curtains, storage changes, etc.
	* This entry for tracking status.
	* 150: Various things in progress, wall around the sink down in prep for new welding curtains (helper lined up).  Shelves on window wall started.  Could use help, lots of projects.
	* 151: To discuss: additional costs/effort due to metal lathe aquision.  Lathe will require a plug, and require e-stop+ contactor to switch the load to the motor.  This is a candidate for a RFID access control.  Looking at using a pump truck to make it possible to move the lathe.
	* 152: Neil - Ticking along, some budget discussion, now sorted; overall on target +/- $100 on entire project.  Lathe is mechanically moving along thanks to Bob; electrical parts on order.
