Welcome to your April, 2016 Financials!

On the Statement of Income & Expense, you'll see that we received $47.50 in donations. $45 was money left in the donation box! So that's exciting. The remaining $2.50 was from a member who had a small credit on account, converting that credit to a donation.

$2,800.00 in membership dues is 56 members invoiced for May. Plus 1 member invoiced in advanced, this number drops us below our 2016 operational budget by 1 member. This reduces our projected operational surplus by $50 ($530, instead of $580), so its not cause for alarm. Based on our budget, we still have a 10 member buffer. As well, we currently have 2 applicants in the pipe, so I expect us to be back above our projected membership numbers by next month.

$580.48 in build-out is Neil's work on the heavy lab. Details on those expenses are included in the Cheques section at the end of the report.

$32.97 in consumables were some drill bits and sharpies. Again, details at the end of the report.

$55.16 in small tools are the new iron and cutting mats for the Silhouette, purchased from the remainder of the TWC project fund.

Our net income for the month is -231.64, but that includes spending which was allocated from elsewhere (heavy lab reorg & TWC). If you look strictly at our operational income ($2800) and expenses ($2,498.66) for the month, we have a net profit of approximately $300. This is a bit lower than is projected in our budget, because April is a higher utilities month. Also, -100 for being down a member and having 1 member who was invoice in advance.

On the Balance Sheet, there are some big changes in the Discretionary Fund:

   * $100 transferred from Discretionary to "Pre-Approved Purchasing" for Bob's metal lathe budget (per PA 336322467361956294)
   * $100 transferred from Discretionary to Heavy Lab Reorg Phase 5 (per Board Meeting 149)
   * $80 transferred from Discretionary to Heavy Lab Reorg Phase 6 (per Board Meeting 149)
   * $276.42 allocated from Discretionary to Heavy lab Reorg Phase 5 (increase to budget, per April 7 "Heavy Lab Reorg Budget" email)
   * $2067.53 in 2015 operational surplus allocated to Discretionary (per Board Meeting 152)
   * $375.72 in 2015 donations transferred from Operations to Discretionary

The Heavy Lab Reorg accounts, you'll note, are pretty much depleted. All the money allocated in April was also spent in April.

The Maker Expo account has a modest increase -- in completing the 2015 year-end last month, I spotted a Maker Expo donation which had not yet been allocated to that account.

The last of the TWC Maker Skills money has been spent (see above, small tools & sharpies). Since this program is now completed, I'll cancel out the 17 cent overdraft from Discretionary, and then remove that account from reports going forward.

In terms of overdue memberships, we have two members who are at or approaching the 60 day mark. The board will be reviewing this accounts at the June board meeting, if they are still outstanding.

Aaand, that's it. As always, let me know if you have any questions!
