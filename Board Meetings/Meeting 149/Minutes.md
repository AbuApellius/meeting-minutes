### Previous Meeting Action Items
* Cedric - contact Dirt & Snow for quotes (was: circulate snow clearing details before next meeting)
	* 148: Invoice has been received and paid, to be removed from future minutes.
	* 149: Reviewed status and emails to Trevor so far; am waiting for a reply confirming the expected window.
* James - Laser Cutter repairs update
        * 143: ($400 USD approved, tube order, laser to be moved, power meter, current check)
        * 144: power meter has arrived, tube has not been ordered yet (some research is required), much measuring has been done
        * 145: laser runs fine at 80%, and no unreliability so long as not overdriven, therefore so not urgent, want to move laser first.  We can get a new tube in about a week, and we have the money reserved.
        * 146: James to finish his diagram and bill of materials so as to make a proper proposal.
        * 147: James is continuing to explore the laser system and looking at the best way to fix/upgrade.
	* 148: Is ongoing, parts are being ordered, parts are in transit, Davenports solution is holding the line for the moment.  Tube is fine, everything else has been other issues.
	* 149: James is on track for having work done by end of Feb.  Laser was offline because someone moved it, and ripped the air hose off; the Jaymis used it on Tuesday, there was air then.  James needs to check the lens, becuase it may have been used while the air was broken, and may therefore be fouled.  If the water had been disconnected, it would have alarmed and shut down.

	* Looking to have KwartzLab on board as sponsor organization for insurance, infrastructure, etc.
	* James is wondering about storage; general discussion.
	* Jaymis is thinking that if it spins off, then it would need it own insurance; which is not expecting to be happening before this event.
	* Ben is looking to streamline re-embursment process this year.
	* James moves that KwartzLab be the supporting organization (which means that the event shall run under the KwartzLab legal entity, insurance, and accounting practices) for Maker Expo 2016.

		* Seconded Christine.
		* Approved, unanimous

* Heavy Lab update from Neil.
	* Ravi can supply 72 tonnes of sand, if we need it for the project.
	* There is a keep clear at all times walkway, we intend to paint it.
	* As an aside: encouraging wardenship - make wardens equivelent of cleaning duty.  Ben volunteered to be computer/printer warden.
		* Christine proposes to discuss next meeting; will be wrapping up TWC around that time,  and is interested in leading the wardenship refresh.
	* Neil distributed a modified plan; has learned at lot about the lab, and how it is used.
		* We now have an entire blacksmithing corner, which has been very useful and popular.
		* Brett Shellhammer has offered to donate a passthrough Air filter; Neil is acting
			* Ravi has had one installed at his shop since 2015-11-20 at his work, has helped considerably; filters have not required replacement yet.
			* Removes heavy particulate from the air; does not touch volitiles
			* unit has remote control and timers
		* Numerous issues with project storage; we have none, and having even some would be interesting.  Neil is looking at trying to make a space where actively used projects can live day to day while in production.
		* Anything not labeled goes out, this already happens, culture seems to be understanding this.
		* If anything is going to be interferring for may than a day or two, then people need to get on the mailing list.  We are seeing people doing this, and culture seems to be demanding it.
		* Welding Bench:
			* plan is to put a metal back-splash to protect the wall at the welding table
			* there are spots around the welding table that need to be blocked, because otherwise it might be possible to directly observe welding arc from the 2nd floor, and between stairs and the wall.
			* t-slot stuff near the welding table is to be removed for fire saftey reasons
			* new welding curtains will be on curtain rods, will no longer consume floor space
		* Budget:
			* spent up to item 4 (painting table and remove bench against laser room wall); note that there is a phase cost and line item cost
			* would like to get approval for both phases 5 (tool/parts/project storage), and 6 (improved welding curtains, blacksmithing table, rebuild steel top bench, sell old welding curtains); detailed discussion of the logic of each item.  
			* Neil is getting a variety of grinding discs; they are cheap, good general resource; if folks want boutique specific wheels, they can bring their own.  About $115.  A formal request will be coming.  Ravi may be able to get us a bulk discount.
		* Proceed with phases 5 & 6:
			* Motion to approve: Steph
			* Seconded: James
			* Approved, unanimous

## Old Business

### Front and Back Doors:
     * 147: Jaymis awaiting quote from G&A before taking further action. Ravi to enquire to see if we can get a second quote. Once quotes are received Jaymis will contact Christian to see about sharing costs.
