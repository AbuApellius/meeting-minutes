## New Business

  * New Membership Process
    * 159: membership committee
      * who can interview members, everyone, at least one needs to know what needs to be asked, what happens if we don't have 3 to interview, they're out of luck. Members have option, but not obligation to vete members.
      * What about 5 day waiting period. Do we still need a board vote (as per bylaws)? Board needs to empower membership committee to make membership decisions. Bylaws do say board has to vote after 5 days for membership. Board can ratify members at monthly meeting, but getting keys and such can be done by membership committee. We could also change bylaw, more work.
      * Approval of new procedures (see Ben's E-mail, BensMembershipEmail.txt)  
      * Getting rid of $100 initial fee
      * membership coordinator. Ben? Single point of contact for new member.
    * Motion to amend existing procedure as per Bens proposal.
      * motion to accept
       * by: Jim
       * seconded: Doug
       * approved: Unanimous
    * Motion to empower Ben as new member coordinator.
      * motion to accept
       * by: Christine
       * seconded: Steph
       * approved: Unanimous
    * Motion to set initial dues to $0 effective Sept 1st, 2016.
     * motion to accept
       * by: James
       * seconded: Doug
       * approved: Unanimous
  * Laser Fix
    * 159: Approval of Tube Expense. James submitted it. ~1400 Cad. Needs to be bank transfer. James will need reimbursement for tax, brokerage and mounts.
      * motion to approve up to $2000 CAD for fixing the laser.
        * by: James
        * seconded: Jim  
        * approved: Unanimous
  * Strategy for Tool Maintenance
    * 159: Ticketing system for marking when maintenance is needed. Big red tags for labelling when tools are bad. Central location for tagging broken equipment. Will help with notification. Dedicated computer for logging damamged tools. We can't label anything, but we do have the list for reporting/issue tracking.
      * Start with tickets. Look at warden to set up and maintain system.
      * Options for resolving tickets: Ticket resolution lottery at next AGM. Every solved ticket is a free drink.
  * Quick Turn Expense Approval / Budgets for Consumables
    * 159: We have enough of a buffer that we could set aside budgets for maintenance and tools. Current standard is up to $50 does not need approval. Consumables is not well defined. Wardens could get a monthly budget that roles over month per month for larger shopping sessions (not necessarily consumables). It's really easy to add new accounts. Projects can always be pre-approved as well.
  * Metal Lathe can be left powered after key removed.
    * 159: Ask Neil about keyswitch.
  * Non-member as secretary for board meetings:
    * 159: Nope, not allowed. Replacement: could let seat be empty, or could do another vote as well. We should find a new board member and secretary. Jim Tigwell will take over as secretary.
    Motion: Jim Tigwell will be new secretary.
