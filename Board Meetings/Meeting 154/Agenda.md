## New Business
* Cedric - would like to re-org Meeting Minutes repo; we have been operating long enough that a single flat directory is awkward; finding specific data is hard.  Would like to add year directories to BOD meetings tree, add dates to directory names so that you can actually easily find a meeting that happened on a given month, and such like.
