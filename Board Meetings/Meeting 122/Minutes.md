### Kwartzlab Governance Follow-up and Brainstorming
* Discussed options for procedure for appointing new members
    * New members can probably be okayed if there are no strong objections from the membership and someone is willing to vouch for them
* How do we handle member terminations in where the situation needs to be handled confidentially?
    * We would need to amend our bylaws to permit this
    * Can we give the board or individual members to temporarily suepend a member?
* Removal of directors
    * Can be done through a general meeting
    * Board members have a responsibility to resign if they are unable to fulfil their responsibilities
* The board should have the ability to terminate a membership
* Responsibilities of the President
    * Delegation
* Should we have a lab manager?
    * Should they be paid?  How much?
    * Would they need to be a board member?
* More responsibilities should be delegated to members
* The board should create specific roles which can be filled by any member who wants to take it
    * This gives the individual members a greater sense of ownership/responsibility
        * Can also cause problems with some people
    * Tool warden?
    * Volunteer coordinator
* The number of things that needs to be handled directly by the board should be minimized
* Suggestion to watch: [RSA Animate - Drive: Surprising truth about what motivates us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)
* Cleaning schedule needs to be back up
* Call for volunteers
