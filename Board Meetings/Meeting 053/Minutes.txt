  5.1. KW Little Theatre Request to use Space
  -------------------------------------------
  
  Karen Murphy, of KW Little Theatre, asked if the theatre could come in one afternoon to build props/sets for an 
  upcoming production. 
  
  There was a brief discussion regarding the request. Concerns were raised regarding the scheduling of this, as 
  members have other events are planned for weekends this month. I.e., Wintereenmas. This could be a good test of 
  how well the space can handle concurrent activities.
  
  If we did enable this, Kwartzlab would not be able to provide storage space for their projects.
  
  Motion Passed: to allow KWLT supervised guest access to build props which they will take home with them.
  So moved by Robert Gissing.
  Seconded by Stephanie Smith
  Discussion: There were questions regarding tool use. Gus said as he be hosting their visit, he would supervise 
  their tool use. His understanding is that they would be mostly using tools which they brought themselves.
