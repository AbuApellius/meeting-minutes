## New Business
* Drew's metal table
       * 147: We are giving one week to see if there is more interest in it on the mailing list - after Neil's grumping on it. If there is no positive feedback about the table, Drew will make it disappear. 
	* 148: 
* "Your mom is not a member. Clean up your dirt."
       * 147: We have cameras pointed at the doors for basic security purposes. Further cameras would be a tech solution to a cultural problem, and not necessarily a useful solution. Overall the lab is getting cleaner - the fact that people are complaining suggests that members are now expecting a certain level of cleanliness. No further action needed at this time. Remove from future minutes.
