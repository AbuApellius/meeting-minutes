      Ben Brown reported that he has not been able to reach Kapley; we may 
      need to talk directly to the Landlord.

      Additionaly, the Board discussed the possibility of drafting a lease 
      agreement ourselves, and presenting that to the Landlord. This may 
      help shorten the negotiation period
