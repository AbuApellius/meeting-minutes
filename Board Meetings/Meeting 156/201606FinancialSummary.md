Welcome to our June Financials!

Looking at our Income & Expense for the month, you'll see a very exciting $1,000 in public support -- this is our annual Proud2Be donation, from Black Berry, which goes straight to our Discretionary Fund.

$2900 in membership fees is 58 invoiced members, plus 1 member who was invoiced a year in advance.

As far as discretionary expenses for the month go, we have $78 in build-out -- that's Neil's work on Phase 6 of the Heavy Lab Reorg project. We also spent approximately $200 on a security camera.

Under our operational expenses, we have about $8.00 in banking fees, $10 in consumables (pallet wrapping), $65 in equipment maintenance (bits in commissioning the metal lathe), $200 in small tools (misc items Neil picked up at auction, hydraulic pallet truck, bench grinder), and $130 for your VCarve software license.

$2900 in operational income, minus $2525 in operational expenses, is an operational surplus of approximately $375. Yay!

As always, the details of all our expenses are at the end of the report.

On the balance sheet, our Discretionary Fund had about $1100 added to it (the Black Berry donation, plus another $100 transferred to Discretionary from earlier donations), and $600 in expenses pulled from it. That gives us a net increase of about $500.

I transferred about 4K from our PayPal account into Operations, so that’s a healthy increase to that account.

About $100 was allocated to Heavy Lab Reorg Phase 6 (approved back in April), but then was promptly spent.

Aaaand, that’s all she wrote. Any questions, lemme know
