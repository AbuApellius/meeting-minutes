Proceedings:
==============

1.  Call to Order
-----------------

Board Chair, Eric Gerlach, called the meeting to order at 1958 EST. The Secretary recorded the minutes. A quorum of directors was present, and the meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business.


2. Approval of the Agenda
-------------------------

The agenda was presented by the Secretary, and approved by the general consent of the Board. 


3. Report from the President
----------------------------

The President reported that he has been in discussion with Martin DeGroot & Open Space; there will be a meeting between our two groups on June 1, where we can discuss opportunities for collaboration.

The President also indicated that he has lined up artists for exhibit in June, July, and September.

There was a brief discussion regarding donation/grant opportunities in the works: TreeHaus has received Trillium monies for organizing public spaces; James Bastow has offered to spearhead this year's Proud2Be applications.


4. Report from the Treasurer
----------------------------

The Treasurer reported that he has just completed a large deposit, and cut a reimbursement cheque to Rob Adler. He also reported that our membership numbers are currently at the break-even point -- any further shrinkage will have us operating in a deficit.

There was a lengthy discussion regarding membership drive initiatives, and ways we might bring new members into the space. Items of interest include purchasing a laser cutter, holding more public workshops, and stronger promotions for public events. 

The Board agreed that this is a discussion which should be held with the membership-at-large, and that the upcoming AGM & party would be an ideal time to do so.


5. Old Business
---------------

  5.1. Heavy Equipment Lab
  ------------------------
  
    5.1.1 Security of Boiler Room Door
    
    Eric Gerlach indicated that installing the new deadbolt requires a 
    drill bit which we do not have in the lab. Cedric Puddy believes 
    has an appropriate bit, and will bring it in.
    
  5.2. Budget Revision
  --------------------
  
  The Treasurer indicated that as the current term is nearly up, he is
  leaving the budget revision as an exercise for the new Treasurer. 
  Robert Gissing now hopes that it won't be him. The Board agreed by 
  general consensus that postponing was fine.
  
  
  5.3. Maker Faire Toronto
  ------------------------
  
  Ben Brown reported to the Board that Maker Faire Toronto fucking 
  rocked. The KwartzLab table was both large and awesome. The liquid 
  nitrogen ice cream workshop was particularly popular, and the moment 
  when Doug froze his shoes was particularly entertaining. 
  
  Ben also reported that the turnout for Maker Faire was excellent -- 
  approximately 3000 people turned out. There has been talk of getting 
  sponsorship from O'Reilly for the next faire.
  
  
  5.4. Health & Safety
  --------------------
  
  The Board agreed by general consensus to approve the new Health & 
  Safety policy, even though it hasn't been reviewed by the lawyer 
  yet. Given the "non-policy" nature of the new policy, there is no 
  tricky legalese to navigate.
  
  Motion: Be it resolved that the following text be adopted as the new 
  Health & Safety Policy of KwartzLab Society Inc.:
  
    "Don't use equipment you don't know how to safely use. When in 
    doubt, find someone who can show you how to use it.

    "Don't use equipment, or the space, in inappropriate ways. 
    Drinking and power tools don't mix.

    "Report broken or damaged equipment to the Tool Committee or 
    the Board of Directors. 

    "If you're alone in the lab, no one can hear you scream. No 
    one can help you, if you have an accident. Make sure you know
    where the emergency phone is, before you need it."
  
  So moved by Robert Gissing.
  Seconded by Ben Brown.
  
  Discussion: There was a brief discussion regarding what should be 
  done in the event of broken or damaged equipment. The Board agreed, 
  by general consensus, to add the following clause to the policy:
  
    "Report broken or damaged equipment to the Tool Committee or 
    the Board of Directors. Put a sign on it. Do not use it."
    
  The Board confirmed that this new Health & Safety policy will need 
  to be added to the membership agreement. Additionally, all current 
  members will need to sign off on it.
  
  In favour: 5
  Opposed: 0
  Abstained: 0
  
  Motion carries.
  
  
  5.5. Trillium Grants
  --------------------

  completing the Trillium Grant application.
  
  
  5.6. Business Plan
  ------------------
  
  No update; item postponed.
    
  5.7. Board Procedure: Approving Public Events
  ---------------------------------------------
  
  Motion: Be it resolved that the Board adopts for the following as a 
  Board Procedure:
  
    "The Board may approve the holding of public events within 
    KwartzLab space through the verbal or written consent of a 
    majority of directors, outside of a Board meeting. Any such 
    approval must be ratified at a future Board meeting."
    
  So moved by Stephanie Smith.
  Seconded by Ben Brown.
  In favour: 5
  Opposed: 0
  Abstained: 0

  5.8. Annual General Meeting
  ---------------------------
  
  The Board reviewed what preparations were necessary for the upcoming 
  Annual General Meeting. 
  
  Stephanie Smith volunteered to act as Elections Co-ordinator.
  
  Motion: Be it resolved that the Board appoints Stephanie Smith as 
  Elections Co-ordinator for the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
  
  So moved by Eric Gerlach.
  Seconded: Cedric Puddy
  In favour: 4
  Opposed: 0
  Abstained: Stephanie Smith
  
  Motion carries.
  
  The Treasurer confirmed that he will have the previous year's 
  financial report ready for the meeting. He also confirmed that he 
  will review the audit waivers before the meeting, to ensure we don't 
  need to appoint an auditor.
  
  There was a brief discussion regarding the current waiver form, and 
  whether it might be simplified, such that merely signing the form 
  indicated consent to waive the audit. The Board agreed by general 
  consent that this change should be made.
  
  Robert Gissing indicated that his Jones soda provided the following 
  fortune: "You will discover a new area of interest." The Board 
  expressed their sympathies & trepidation.
  
  Eric Gerlach proposed the following agenda for the Annual General 
  Meeting:
  
    President
    2010 Financial Report
    Board Elections
    Adjournment
    
  The Board approved this by general consensus. Eric indicated that he 
  will formalize the agenda tonight, and give it to Robert Gissing. 
  Gus indicated that he will send out the AGM announcement once he has 
  the finalized Agenda, later this evening.
  
  Motion: Be it resolved that that on Saturday June 4, at 7pm, 
  KwartzLab Society Inc., will hold its Annual General meeting, at the 
  headquarters of the corporation.
  
  So moved by Eric Gerlach.
