Dedicated computer for logging damamged tools. We can't label anything, but we do have the list for reporting/issue tracking.

* Quick Turn Expense Approval / Budgets for Consumables
    * 159: We have enough of a buffer that we could set aside budgets for maintenance and tools. Current standard is up to $50 does not need approval. Consumables is not well defined. Wardens could get a monthly budget that roles over month per month for larger shopping sessions (not necessarily consumables). It's really easy to add new accounts. Projects can always be pre-approved as well.

    * 161: Will depend on the way the 2017 Operating Budget is organized.
